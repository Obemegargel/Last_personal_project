# Overview
I wanted to write a program in Java to better understand the basics of the language. I decided to make a program that added to an ArrayList. I also incorporated various functions that talk to each other in order to maximise versatility. I also incorporated multiple classes to improve versatility as well.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 I want to have the option to add the array from mathfunction to the array.
- Item 2 Make each little function a seperate class.
- Item 3 Make more options and connections between functions to give more options and checks.
